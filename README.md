# Registration Form
This project is a simple registration form built with React. It allows users to register by providing their name, email, date of birth, city, and postal code. The registration form includes validation for each field, preventing submission if any field is invalid. Upon successful registration, the data is saved to the local storage, and a success message is displayed. If there are validation errors, an error message is displayed below each invalid field in red.
